# DLAV_3DHumanPose

This work is mainly done based on the following github repo https://github.com/redrock303/HEMlets. The folder HEMlets is contains the code of the repo
And following the two linked papers:
HEMlets Pose: Learning Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets for Accurate 3D Human Pose Estimation

HEMlets PoSh: Learning Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets for 3D Human Pose and Shape  Estimation

Copied and pasted from the original git (mentionned above)

We provide quick inference code to validate and visualize our results on [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php). Brief runing instructions are given below.
1. Pre installation\
 create a new conda vitual environment\
 conda/pip install -r requirement.txt
2. Download the pre-trained model and the tiny dataset(a pre-processed testing video from Human3.6M) at [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pg35KvvqUK5jX8UMRk_emQ) [code:HEMs] or [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8Jj0xx4SvHC-YKuw_M_c_Z4vA4HpzID?usp=sharing).
3. Visualization and evaluation on a single video from Human3.6M.
   We implement a script for visualization and evaluation of the predicted results on Human3.6M by running the command:\
   ```bash inference.sh```\"
